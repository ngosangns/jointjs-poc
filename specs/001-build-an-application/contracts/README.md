# Contracts

This directory describes the expected behavior of the library APIs and events. Contract tests live under `lib/tests/contract` and should fail initially (TDD) until features are implemented.

- Library APIs: create/load/save/export/import; element/link CRUD; grouping; layers; view; history.
- Events: selection; element/link added/updated/removed; viewport; document saved/loaded.
