## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story

As a user, I want to create, edit, and share diagrams in a canvas-based editor that behaves like draw.io so that I can rapidly model flows, architectures, and processes with familiar interactions and tools.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a blank canvas, **When** the user drags a shape from the palette onto the canvas, **Then** the shape appears with default styling and can be moved, resized, and edited inline.
2. **Given** two shapes on the canvas, **When** the user connects them using a connector tool, **Then** a link is created with routing, attach points/ports, and interactive handles for adjustment.
3. **Given** multiple shapes selected via marquee or Shift+click, **When** the user uses alignment tools, **Then** the shapes align uniformly with visible guidelines and snapping feedback.
4. **Given** a diagram in progress, **When** the user presses Cmd/Ctrl+Z or uses the toolbar to undo, **Then** the last atomic change is reverted; redo restores it.
5. **Given** a complex diagram, **When** the user pans (mouse-drag/spacebar) and zooms (wheel/pinch/controls), **Then** the viewport updates smoothly without layout shifts.
6. **Given** a diagram with layers and groups, **When** the user toggles layer visibility/lock or groups/ungroups selection, **Then** the elements respond accordingly without affecting cross-layer items.
7. **Given** a diagram, **When** the user saves it, **Then** the full diagram state (shapes, links, styles, layers, groups, text) is persisted and can be reopened identically.
8. **Given** a finished diagram, **When** the user exports as PNG/SVG/PDF, **Then** the exported file captures visual fidelity at chosen scale/background options.
9. **Given** a diagram, **When** the user edits text within shapes/connectors (double-click) and applies formatting, **Then** text updates inline and flows correctly.
10. **Given** a selection, **When** the user presses Delete or uses context menu "Delete", **Then** selected elements are removed and undoable.
11. **Given** the grid/snapping is toggled, **When** the user moves/resizes elements, **Then** snapping behavior follows the toggle state and spacing settings.
12. **Given** keyboard shortcuts are used (e.g., copy/paste/duplicate, arrow nudge), **When** invoked, **Then** the corresponding actions execute and are undoable.
13. **Given** templates/stencils are available, **When** the user inserts a template, **Then** a multi-element structure appears with preserved relationships and styles.
14. **Given** the user imports a supported file (e.g., draw.io XML), **When** the file is opened, **Then** the diagram renders with equivalent semantics or clear error mapping.

### Edge Cases

- Very large diagrams (e.g., 5,000+ elements): performance and interaction remain responsive; degradation thresholds are defined. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance targets]
- Extremely long text labels: text wraps/ellipsis without canvas overflow.
- Dense parallel connectors: link routing avoids overlaps where possible; manual routing preserved.
- Rapid input sequences (e.g., 50 undos redos quickly): history remains consistent; no stale selection.
- Mixed device inputs (mouse, trackpad, touch): gestures coexist; accidental multi-touch is ignored. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: touch scope]
- High-DPI export: exported assets are crisp at 1x/2x/4x scales.
- Import of malformed files: user sees a clear validation error with line/element reference when possible.
- Browser/tab crash or refresh: autosave prevents significant data loss; last autosave is recoverable. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: autosave interval]
- International text and RTL: text input, resizing, and alignment support Unicode/RTL.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Users MUST create, open, and save diagrams from a start screen and within the editor.
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a searchable shape library/palette organized by categories (flowchart, UML, BPMN, network, basic shapes).
- **FR-003**: Users MUST drag-drop shapes to the canvas and position/resize them with handles and snapping guides.
- **FR-004**: Users MUST connect shapes with orthogonal and straight connectors; connectors attach to ports/sides and support waypoints.
- **FR-005**: Links MUST support labels, arrowheads, styles, and manual routing adjustments.
- **FR-006**: Users MUST multi-select (marquee, Shift+click), group/ungroup, and reorder z-index.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide alignment and distribution tools with visual guidelines.
- **FR-008**: Users MUST toggle grid and adjust grid spacing; elements snap to grid/guides when enabled.
- **FR-009**: Users MUST pan and zoom via mouse, trackpad, keyboard, and UI controls.
- **FR-010**: Undo/redo MUST support a linear history of atomic actions across all edit operations.
- **FR-011**: Users MUST edit text inline on shapes and links with basic formatting (font, size, style, color, alignment).
- **FR-012**: Users MUST duplicate, copy/paste within the canvas, and paste style separately from geometry.
- **FR-013**: Users MUST manage layers (add, rename, reorder, visibility, lock) and move elements between layers.
- **FR-014**: Users MUST apply styles/themes to shapes and links and set defaults for new elements.
- **FR-015**: Users MUST snap connectors to defined ports or sides and change port positions where applicable.
- **FR-016**: Users MUST insert images/icons and manage their aspect ratio and embedding options. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: external URLs vs embedded]
- **FR-017**: Users MUST configure page settings (size, orientation, background color/grid, margins) and print.
- **FR-018**: Users MUST export diagrams as PNG, SVG, and PDF with scale and transparency options.
- **FR-019**: Users MUST import diagrams from at least draw.io XML. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: additional formats]
- **FR-020**: Autosave MUST periodically persist the working diagram without user action. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: interval, storage location]
- **FR-021**: Users MUST access a minimap/overview panel to navigate large diagrams.
- **FR-022**: Users MUST have a context menu and toolbar with commonly used actions and visible keyboard shortcuts.
- **FR-023**: Keyboard shortcuts MUST cover selection, editing, navigation, and formatting actions, matching draw.io conventions where feasible.
- **FR-024**: Users MUST set and use templates (document-level and element-level) and custom shape sets.
- **FR-025**: Users MUST collapse/expand containers and use swimlanes/pools with child element management.
- **FR-026**: System MUST preserve manual routing and layout choices on subsequent edits.
- **FR-027**: Users MUST lock elements to prevent accidental edits.
- **FR-028**: System MUST provide accessible interactions (focus, ARIA where applicable) and contrast-compliant UI. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: accessibility targets]
- **FR-029**: Users MUST search within the diagram (by label, type) and highlight results.
- **FR-030**: Users MUST manage document settings and metadata (title, author, last modified).
- **FR-031**: System SHOULD offer basic collaboration options (share link/export). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: real-time collaboration in scope?]
- **FR-032**: System MUST preserve and restore editor state (zoom, pan, selection) on file open where appropriate.

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)

- **Diagram**: A document containing pages, elements, links, layers, styles, and metadata.

- **Template**: A predefined arrangement of multiple elements/links that can be inserted.
