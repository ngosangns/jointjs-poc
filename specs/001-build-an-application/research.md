# Research: Draw.io-like Diagramming Application

**Status**: âœ… All decisions implemented and validated

## Decisions

- **Testing Stack**: Unit with Jest; Integration/E2E with Playwright. âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Performance Targets**: Smooth pan/zoom at 60 fps for typical diagrams; acceptable 30-45 fps for heavy cases. Target up to 3,000 elements interactive, 10,000 elements view-only. âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Touch Scope**: Desktop primary; basic touch (pan/zoom/select) supported; advanced gestures (multi-touch rotate) deferred. âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Accessibility**: Aim for WCAG 2.1 AA for UI controls; canvas interactions provide keyboard alternatives where feasible. âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Import/Export**: Import draw.io XML v4+; Export PNG, SVG, PDF. Additional imports (Visio, SVG parse) deferred. âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Autosave**: Every 5 seconds of idle or after 20 atomic operations (whichever first). Recovery on reload via latest autosave. âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
- **IndexedDB**: One database `diagram_core` with stores: `documents`, `assets`. Versioned schema (v1). âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
- **CLI Exposure**: Not required for end-users; provide dev scripts via package.json. âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**

## Rationale

- Jest + Playwright are standard in TS/Angular ecosystems with good DX and CI support.
- 3k elements interactive aligns with practical usage; beyond that needs virtualization or UX adaptation.
- Basic touch ensures tablet usability without complicating MVP scope.
- WCAG AA is a reasonable baseline for a web app toolbar/menus; canvas has limitations but will provide focus, ARIA for controls.
- Draw.io XML covers core parity goal; export trio matches common share/use cases.
- Autosave balance reduces data loss while avoiding constant writes.
- IndexedDB schema separates documents and binary assets for flexibility and performance.
- Avoiding CLI keeps scope lean; dev ergonomics remain via npm/yarn scripts.

## Alternatives Considered

- Testing: Karma/Jasmine (native Angular) â†’ slower runs, less flexible mocking.
- Storage: LocalStorage â†’ insufficient capacity; File System Access API â†’ limited support.
- Performance: WebGL-rendered canvas â†’ higher complexity; keep SVG/HTML with JointJS first.
- Import breadth: Support Visio early â†’ high effort for limited immediate value.

## Unknowns Resolved

- **Testing tooling**: âœ… RESOLVED (Jest, Playwright) - **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Performance targets**: âœ… RESOLVED (3k interactive, fps goals) - **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Touch scope**: âœ… RESOLVED (basic touch only) - **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Accessibility targets**: âœ… RESOLVED (WCAG 2.1 AA for UI) - **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Formats beyond draw.io**: âœ… RESOLVED (deferred) - **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Autosave policy**: âœ… RESOLVED (5s/20 ops) - **IMPLEMENTED**
- **CLI exposure**: âœ… RESOLVED (not required) - **IMPLEMENTED**
